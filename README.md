# General Things TODO

* Add ID to rule instances so the effects of a rule can be tracked.  
  Then if a rule is canceled, effects can be removed.  
  If the rule is dynamic, its prior effects can be removed if needed.

* Subscribe to UNIS updates in the runtime, re-run monitors when changes occur
* Graph transformation functions
* Combiners for groups
